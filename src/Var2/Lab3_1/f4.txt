Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad 63 14
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had 69 15
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh 64 13
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 56 13
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers 71 12
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares 67 11
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it 49 10
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it 83 16
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls 63 13
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls 60 10
 2 1
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you 55 10
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news 56 10
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems 59 12
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me 63 14
All the things growing up, his daddy, daddy had to see 56 11
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did 65 15
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me 55 13
But things have gotten so bad between us, I don't see us ever being together 78 15
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
